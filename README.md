# AMBvis

A platform for visualizing interactions of (anaerobic) microorganisms. This repository contains the software needed for controlling the system. The system is based on a Raspberry Pi, using a Pi-Plates MOTORplate for smooth stepper motor control.

**Figure 1**. A high-magnification lens is mounted on a carriage which is movable using the software. Aluminium extrusions (not shown) hold the samples in place over the lens.
